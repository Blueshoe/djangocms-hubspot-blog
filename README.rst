==================================
djangoCMS Hubspot Blog Integration
==================================

- Management command to fetch Authors, Topics and Posts and store them in the database    
- djangoCMS App to hook list and detail view into a page

Usage
==================================

- ``pip install djangocms-hubspot-blog``     
- Add the app ``djangocms_hubspot_blog`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
- Add the string settings ``HUBSPOT_API_KEY``, ``HUBSPOT_BLOG_ID``, ``PORTAL_ID`` and optional ``HUBSPOT_BLOG_PAGE_LIMIT``
- Override the two templates ``djangocms_hubspot_blog/[post_list.html,post_detail.html]``

How to fetch blog posts
-----------------------
**Automatically**

The best aproach is to **automatically** fetch posts, authors and topics by
periodically running the management command ``import_blog_posts`` via CRON
or calling ``djangocms_hubspot_api.update_blog_posts()`` from a task queue.

**Manually**

However, it's also possible for site editors to **manually** trigger an
update via an admin action (it's needed to select a blog post in order
to run the action, so for the first time use, run the management command or create a dummy blog post via the admin)

Missing Functionality
-------------------------
- Author page    
- Topic page
